Color Theory Overview:

Color theory is the application of color and its properties to achieve artistic or practical goals. These outcomes can include influencing emotion, creating moods, communicating specific messages, and producing effective and appealing designs. Essentially, color theory is used to communicate using the language of color—involving combinations, perceptions, contrasts and complements. Graphic design, advertising, interior design, fashion and marketing are among the areas where color theory is an essential tool.

Color Theory Definitions:
1.	Color Wheel: A basic tool in color theory, the color wheel clearly shows how colors relate to one another, including color schemes and contrasts.
2.	Primary Colors: These are pure colors that cannot be created by mixing other colors. The primary colors are red, blue and yellow.
3.	Secondary Colors: These are colors created by mixing two primary colors. Green (blue plus yellow), violet (blue plus red) and orange (red plus yellow) are examples of secondary colors.
4.	Tertiary Colors: These are created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color. Tertiary colors include blue-violet, blue-green, yellow-green, yellow-orange, red-orange and red-violet.
5.	Color Harmonies: Balanced combinations that create interest and are artistically pleasing. 
6.	Complementary Colors: Situated at opposite ends of the color wheel, these colors create strong contrast.
7.	Neutral Colors: While they appear to lack color, neutral colors have hues that can change with different lighting. Beige, taupe, gray, cream, brown, black and white are examples.
8.	Warm Colors: These colors convey a sense of energy and warmth, as well as strong emotion. Examples include red, orange and brown.
9.	Cool Colors: Blue, green and purple are examples of cool colors, which can evoke peacefulness and calm.
10.	Color Scheme: An arrangement or combination of colors used for a certain effect in areas such as graphic and interior design. Color schemes are created for a cohesive look and feel.
11.	Mode: Color modes are different ways of presenting colors for digital or print projects. RGB (red, green, blue) is used for digital displays, while CYMK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is used for print projects.
12.	Saturation: This aspect of color describes how pure or rich a color appears. Saturation can range from vivid and intense to muted and dull.
13.	Hues: A hue refers to the basic, pure color conveyed—essentially, it’s the location of a particular color on the color wheel
14.	Shades: Color shades are created by adding black to a pure color (hue). The result is a darker color.
15.	Contrast (color): This refers to the difference in brightness, hue and saturation between colors. In design terms, contrast is how colors stand out against each other.
16.	Tints: These are colors created by adding white to a pure hue. By increasing lightness and decreasing saturation, tints result in a softer appearance.
17.	Tones: Tones are created by adding grey (black and white) to a hue. This aspect of color results in muted, understated effects.
18.	Vibrancy: This aspect of color includes the brightness and energy of a hue. Vibrancy can convey energy and warmth, depending on the intent of the design.
19.	Monochromatic: This term refers to a color scheme created from a single hue, using shades, tones and tints.
20.	 Analogous Colors: In color theory, these are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
