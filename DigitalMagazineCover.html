<h2>Photoshop Project: Digital Magazine Cover</h2>

<p>My first portfolio item is a fictional <i>"Tech Icons"</i> magzine cover featuring Steve Jobs. 
    Admittedly a throwback magazine cover, this Photoshop effort used layering, silo'ing and gradient techniques to achieve the desired look. 
    After searching for (free) images, I created a few rough layouts before deciding on a look I liked.
    Layers were arranged so that type segments were easily identified. Silo and masks were used for all of the images, 
    especially around Jobsâ€™ hand (to make it appear to be holding the USB cord). Original images were maintained. 
    The background is achieved with a color fill (black) base layer, a blue gradient layer, and an overlaying grey radiant layer. 
   A challenge was using the magnetic lasso tool to silo the hand.</p>
