<h2>Photoshop Project: Digital Magazine Cover</h2>

<p>My first portfolio item is a fictional <i>"Tech Icons"</i> magzine cover featuring Steve Jobs. 
    Admittedly a throwback magazine cover, this Photoshop effort used layering, silo'ing and gradient techniques to achieve the desired look. 
    After searching for (free) images, I created a few rough layouts before deciding on a look I liked.
    Layers were arranged so that type segments were easily identified. Silo and masks were used for all of the images, 
    especially around Jobs’ hand (to make it appear to be holding the USB cord). Original images were maintained. 
    The background is achieved with a color fill (black) base layer, a blue gradient layer, and an overlaying grey radiant layer. 
   A challenge was using the magnetic lasso tool to silo the hand.</p>
