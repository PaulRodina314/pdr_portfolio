<h1>Types of Fonts</h1>
<body>
<p>
The main types of fonts are <b>serif, sans-serif, decorative, script</b> and <b>monospace.</b> Each font type has a different look and design use.</p> 

<p><b>Serif fonts</b> have the tails or decorative strokes at the end of the letters. These fonts have a very traditional look and are used extensively for large blocks of running body text, such as in books, newspapers, magazines and websites Examples include <span style="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">Times New Roman Bold</span> and <span style="font-family: Charter Bold">Charter</span> (bold here). While Times New Roman is usually installed with the Mac or Windows OS, it can be found on  <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com">Adobe Fonts</a> or <a href="https://www.myfonts.com">My Fonts</a>. Charter can be found at <a href="https://fontesk.com">Fontesk</a>, among other locations.</p>

<p><b>Sans-serif</b> fonts do not have the strokes at the ends of letters, and consequently have a more clean and modern look. Sans-serif fonts are used in designing display type, headlines and websites. Examples include <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Helvetica</span> (regular here) and <span style="font-family: Futura Medium">Futura</span> (medium here). Helevetica and Futura can be acquired at <a href="https://myfonts.com">MyFonts</a> or through <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com">Adobe Fonts</a>, among other sites.</p>

<p><b>Script fonts</b> are designed to present handwritten or cursive styles. These fonts can be elegantly formal or everyday casual. Script fonts are used in the design of greeting cards, invitations, logos, headlines and display text. An example of a formal script font would be <span style="font-family: Brush Script MT">Brush Script MT</span> (<a href="https://fonts.adobe.com">Adobe Fonts</a> or <a href="https://freefontdownload.org">Free Font Download</a>). A more relaxed and fun font would be <span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Comic Sans MS</span>, also available online from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com">Adobe Fonts</a>, among other sites.

<p><b>Decorative fonts</b> are aptly named—they are unique fonts that are ideally used in posters, advertisements and logos. Decorative fonts catch the viewer’s attention; examples include <span style="font-family: Copperplate">Copperplate Gothic</span> and <span style="font-family: Baskerville Semibold Italic">Baskerville Semibold Italic</span>. Copperplate and Baskerville are available from <a href="https://myfonts.com">MyFonts</a>.

<p><b>Monoface fonts</b> are used in coding and digital applications; the characters in Monoface fonts all have the same width and have a typewriter- or computer-like appearance. Examples include <span style="font-family: Monaco">Monaco</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier">Courier</span>. Both Monaco and Courier are installed on Mac and Windows operating systems.
