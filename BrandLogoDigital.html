<h2>Photoshop Project: Logo for Fictional Electric Vehicle Company</h2>

<p>After researching various electric vehicle logos, I decided to create a clean, simple, sharp vision for this fictional brand. I used the Photoshop type tool and borrowed a mountain-ridge shape from the Photoshop shapes library. A simple gradient was applied to the background mountains. I thought that the Sackers Gothic typeface contributed to a clean expression while not looking too cold and technical. 
I rasterized the layers so that I could use the Free Transform tool to manipulate the size and copy the logo into other parts of this project.</p>

<p>For the LinkedIn banner, I checked online for workable dimensions (1584 pixels by 396 pixels). Again, I wanted to keep this clean and simple, so I downloaded the background image from Adobe Stock (after searching for “mountains and lightning”) and just set it at an opacity of 20% so the highlight is still the company logo.</p>
