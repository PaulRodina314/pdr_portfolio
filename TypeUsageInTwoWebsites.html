<h1>Typography Comparison of Two Websites</h1>
<body>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com">Simon & Schuster</a><br>
    <a href="https://www.fordham.edu">Fordham University</a></p>

<p>I chose to discuss the typography of these two websites because of their font choices to represent what are very traditional (book publishing and higher education) organizations.</p>

<p>I found that the combination of Serif and Sans-Serif fonts in the Simon and Schuster website helped to establish a hierarchy of information, conveying road signs to guide the visitor:</p>

<br>
<p>The headline and section fonts repeat the font of the Simon and Schuster logo, creating a guiding continuity. The clear and simple San-Serif fonts in the book listings give the necessary information while not interfering the books, which are the stars of the website:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>I was interested in the Fordham University website because the school had recently decided on a rebranding, which meant changing the font and appearance of the school logo:</p>

<pr>Here's the "old" logo:</pr>

<br>
<p>And, here's the new look:</p>

<br>
<br>
The website, I believe, stays consistent with this updated typography. The San-Serif fonts (bold for headlings) are clear, accessible and provide great direction. Itâ€™s a sleek, modern look that gives information quickly. The use of color for the font reflects the school's color and is consistent throughout, providing a steady guide to the sections of the site:

<br>
<br>
<p>Both the Simon & Schuster and Fordham websites make effective use of type by relying on their logos to provide a consistent structure for display type, while using clear sans-serif type faces to convey the main content of the pages.</p>
